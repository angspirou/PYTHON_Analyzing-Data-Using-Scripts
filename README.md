# PYTHON_Analyzing-Data-Using-Scripts

### In this repository, you will find two different Python challenges named "PyBank" and "PyPoll." 

### For the PyBank challenge, a script named "PyBankScript_ASpirou" was written in order to analyze financial records and to create a text file output of the results. 

### For the PyPoll challenge, a script named "PyPollScript_ASpirou" was written in order to assist in the vote-counting process and to once again, create a text file output of the results. 

### Each challenge can be found in their corresponding folders.
